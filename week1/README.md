# WEEK 1

The task today is to get setup with git/github and make changes to your own branch.

The first goal is to make an edit to a file so everyone can see it in the remote repository.

Before you do anything, you need to switch to your own branch. You can do this by typing `git checkout <your name>`

First, with any text editor of your choice, edit the file in this directory called editme to say a message of your choice

Once you've saved this file with your changes, you need to _stage_ the change. git doesn't care about a file until you tell it to.

To stage a change, type the command `git add editme`
Now, commit the change with a command like `git commit -m "added message to editme"`
Finally, to move your commit from your computer to the Github repo use the command `git push`

Let me know when you get that done so I can see if I can view your message from my computer.
